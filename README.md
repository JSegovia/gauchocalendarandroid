## What is GauchoCalendar?
With students being encouraged to participate in clubs and organizations on campus to enrich their college experience, 
we have made it our goal to design a program that allows students to generate a schedule that allows them to participate 
in these extracurriculars while still being able to attend all of their classes. Similar to the online web application ninja courses,
our application will incorporate the main principle of generating class schedules while adding other features to further develop the 
application onto a mobile device. Some of these additional features that will be offered will include a login for both students and 
faculty. Students will have the ability to input their extracurricular activities to allow the scheduler to avoid those times if 
possible. It will also be able to take multiple classes as inputs for the quarter and prioritize the classes, so if a student doesn’t
really care about their third or fourth class as a GE the schedule generator will select the best fit class to work with their schedule. We are also planning on including an interaction with Rate my Professor to display professor ratings and have an option for students to comment on previous classes within the app itself. Students will be able to list the previous courses they took to make sure that they have met the prerequisites for the course and maybe have the app suggest classes to take to fulfill their GE requirements. Another option that could be implemented is that the application could import all of the student’s time commitments into google calendar so they can have it on their phone to give reminders like what class and which classroom they are in. Students could download/ save the generated schedules so they only have to add one event to their calendar if making any changes. The faculty or professor log-in will allow professors to choose the classes they are teaching and offer time suggestions for office hours depending on their preferences and maybe potentially use information from students signed up for the class to determine when most of the students will be able to attend an office hours appointment. 

## How to get this app running
### Step 1
As of this moement, we have been working only with Android Studio so you will need to install everything necessary to run android studio. This means that if you have a Macbook you will need to download Xcode. Windows, Linux, and Apple all require you to download the latest SDK. This README will constantly be updated when we figure out other ways to run the app like using Eclipse. You can read more about what your computer will need for Android Studio here:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html

### Step 2
When you open up Android Studio for the first time it will provide you with multiple options for getting started.
If you already have worked with Android Studio you should just go to File > close project.
It will take you to a page like this:
![Alt tag](https://github.com/JSegovia/gauchocalendarandroid/blob/master/app/src/main/res/drawable/studio-welcomeReadme.png)

You will want to click on the option "Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)"
You will be walked through on how to import the project.

### Step 3
Once you have the project up in your Android Studio then click the play button to run it.
