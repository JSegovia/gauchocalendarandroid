## What is GauchoCalendar?
With students being encouraged to participate in clubs and organizations on campus to enrich their college experience, 
we have made it our goal to design a program that allows students to generate a schedule that allows them to participate 
in these extracurriculars while still being able to attend all of their classes. Similar to the online web application ninja courses,
our application will incorporate the main principle of generating class schedules while adding other features to further develop the 
application onto a mobile device.  Students will have the ability to input their extracurricular activities to allow the scheduler to avoid those times if 
possible. 

## How to get this app running
### Step 1
As of this moement, we have been working only with Android Studio so you will need to install everything necessary to run android studio. This means that if you have a Macbook you will need to download Xcode. Windows, Linux, and Apple all require you to download the latest SDK. This README will constantly be updated when we figure out other ways to run the app like using Eclipse. You can download Android Studio here:

### Step 2
Here is a youtube video that gives you a step by step instructions on how to import a project from GitHub to Android Studio:

### Step 3
Once you have the project up in your Android Studio then click the play button to run it. If you do not have an android device you will need to create an emulator and run it on that. Just as a note, the smaller the emulator phone the better it will run.
